Designing the API (endpoints, request/response structure)

Implementing the API using a backend framework (e.g. Flask, FastAPI, Django, Express.js, etc.)

Documenting the API (e.g. Swagger/OpenAPI)

Testing it (unit tests, integration tests, etc.)

Securing it (auth, rate limits, input validation)

Versioning (so older clients donâ€™t break with changes)


HTTP Method	  Endpoint	     Description
GET	          /tasks	       Get all tasks
POST	        /tasks	       Create a new task
PUT	          /tasks/1	     Update task with ID 1
DELETE	      /tasks/1	       Delete task with ID 1
